# SelfCheckout

In the assignment, we have to design a self-checkout system called GoScanYourself. The current client is a large supermarket chain, and they want a system that is pleasant and easy to use for their customers. They want the system to be based on a touchscreen with separate barcode readers and credit card readers.
